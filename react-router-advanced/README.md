# REACT ROUTER ADVANCED

 # Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced routing techniques in a React application using React Router v6.
It focuses on:

Nested routes (Profile sub-pages: details, settings)

Protected routes with authentication

Dynamic routes (Blog posts with variable IDs)

Error handling for unmatched routes


The goal is to build a robust, scalable React application with clean route management, proper authentication flow, and dynamic content rendering.

# Key Features

ðŸ”¹ Nested Routes

Profile page has sub-routes for ProfileDetails and ProfileSettings.

Navigation is seamless within the profile section.


ðŸ”¹ Protected Routes

Certain routes (e.g., /profile) require authentication.

Implemented via ProtectedRoute.jsx using React Context (AuthContext).

Redirects unauthenticated users to /login.


ðŸ”¹ Dynamic Routes

Blog posts have dynamic URLs: /blog/:postId.

Post.jsx fetches the post from data/posts.js based on the postId parameter.


ðŸ”¹ Error Handling

NotFound.jsx handles unmatched routes (path="*").


ðŸ”¹ Navigation

NavBar.jsx provides navigation links for Home, Blog, Login, Profile, etc.

# Implementation Details

App.jsx: Sets up routing with <Routes> and <Route> components.

AuthContext.jsx: Manages authentication state globally.

ProtectedRoute.jsx: Wraps protected routes, checks isAuthenticated state, redirects if needed.

Blog.jsx & Post.jsx: Render posts list and individual post based on postId.

Profile.jsx: Acts as a layout for nested routes (details, settings).

NotFound.jsx: Generic 404 page for unknown routes.

# Sample Navigation Flow

/           â†’ Home
/blog       â†’ Blog list
/blog/1     â†’ Post details for postId=1
/login      â†’ Login form
/profile    â†’ Protected Route
   /details   â†’ Profile details (nested)
   /settings  â†’ Profile settings (nested)
/unknown    â†’ 404 NotFound page
