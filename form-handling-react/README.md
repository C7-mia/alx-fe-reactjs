# Form Handling in React

This project demonstrates **form handling in React** using two approaches:
1. **Controlled Components** â€“ Managing form state manually with `useState`.
2. **Formik + Yup** â€“ Advanced form handling with validation.

The app includes a **user registration form** with fields for:
- Username
- Email
- Password

Both forms simulate user registration by sending data to a **mock API endpoint** (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`).
